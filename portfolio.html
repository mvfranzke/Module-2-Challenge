                <p><em>Mabuhay!</em> My name is Michelle, I'm from the Philippines and recently moved to sunny San Diego.
                    I worked as a quality analyst and have 15 years of experience in customer service. I've worked in various industry from
                    telecommunications, technology to banking and finance.
                <p> I'm currently taking Coding Bootcamp            certification through UC San Diego Extended Studies (HTML, CSS, Javascript). I'm experienced in MS Excel (pivot, data management, graph, macro etc.) MS Word and Powerpoint. I value attention to detail, accuracy and timely completion of projects, therefore regular communication is very important to me.

                <p>During my freetime I love to go hiking, camping, join fun-run events and ride my beachcruiser along the boardwalk.
