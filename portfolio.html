        <><em>Mabuhay!</em> My name is Michelle. I'm from the Philippines and recently moved to sunny San Diego.
            I worked as a quality analyst and have 14 years of experience in customer service. I've worked in various
            industries from
            telecommunications, technology to banking and finance.
        <p> I'm currently taking a coding certification bootcamp class through University of California San Diego (UCSD)
            Extended Studies (HTML, CSS, Javascript). I'm experienced in MS Excel (pivot, data management, graph, macro
            etc.), MS Word and Powerpoint. I value attention to detail, accuracy and timely completion of projects,
            therefore, regular communication is very important to me.</p>
        <p>During my freetime I love to go hiking, camping, join fun-run events and ride my beach cruiser along the
            boardwalk.</p>
