# Module-2-Challenge (Porfolio)

## Description

This is the second assignment or challenge for our bootcamp class, we're tasked to create a webpage from scratch and create our personal portfolio. The webpage shows photo of myself, navigation bar with 4 selections - About Me, Projects, Contacts and Resume, which is linked to the section in the same page. About me section have a brief description of myself, my skills, work experience and hobbies. Projects section list 5 image placeholder for my future projects, as the mouse hoves on it, it reacts differently. Contacts section shows my location, phone number, email, social media page and github link. Resume section houses the link of my resume pdf.

In this assignment I was able to apply the skills we learned from last weeks CSS lesson - among them are flexbox, CSS variables and media queries.
